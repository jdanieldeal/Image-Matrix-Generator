### How to Run a Python Program on macOS and Windows (Simple Steps)

#### For macOS:
1. **Check if Python is already installed**:
   - Open **Terminal** (press `Cmd + Space`, type "Terminal", and press `Enter`).
   - Type `python3 --version` and press `Enter`.
   - If Python is installed, you'll see a version number. If not, continue to step 2.

2. **Install Python**:
   - Open **Terminal** and type this command to install Python using Homebrew (if you don't have Homebrew, install it first by going to https://brew.sh):
     ```bash
     brew install python
     ```
   - Wait for Python to install.

3. **Write and Save Your Program**:
   - Use any text editor (like TextEdit) to write your Python code and save it as `script.py`.

4. **Run Your Program**:
   - Open **Terminal** and navigate to the folder where your script is saved. For example, if it's on your Desktop, type:
     ```bash
     cd ~/Desktop
     ```
   - Then, run the program by typing:
     ```bash
     python3 script.py
     ```

#### For Windows:
1. **Check if Python is installed**:
   - Open **Command Prompt** (press `Win + R`, type "cmd", and press `Enter`).
   - Type `python --version` and press `Enter`.
   - If Python is installed, you'll see a version number. If not, go to step 2.

2. **Install Python**:
   - **Windows 10/11** often comes with Python. If not, type this command in Command Prompt:
     ```cmd
     python
     ```
   - Windows will guide you to install Python if itâ€™s missing.

3. **Write and Save Your Program**:
   - Use a text editor like Notepad to write your Python code and save it as `script.py` on your Desktop.

4. **Run Your Program**:
   - Open **Command Prompt** and type:
     ```cmd
     cd Desktop
     ```
   - Then, run your script by typing:
     ```cmd
     python script.py
     ```
